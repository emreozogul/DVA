# Dynamic Viability Analysis of Drug-Treated Cancer Cells with Incremental Learning Algorithms (DVA)

## Introduction
This project, DVA, develops a desktop application to classify drug-treated cancer cells using machine learning. It aims to automate the analysis of cell viability and death levels, enhancing the accuracy and speed of research in cancer treatments.

## Features
- **Automated Analysis**: Automatically determine the viability of cancer cells from images.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Includes Threshold algorithms, Contour Detection etc. to prepare images for machine learning analysis.
- **Incremental Machine Learning Model**: Uses an Incremental Machine learning model that adapts and improves over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible for both technical and non-technical users.
